# Junit-example
This is a basic Junit Example to test the following condition:
    	Remove 'A' if it is present in first 2 characters of the string.
      If 'A' is present after 2 characters, it should not be removed.
			
      Ex: "ABCD" => "BCD"
					"AACD" => "CD"
					"BACD" => "BCD"
					"BBAA" => "BBAA"
					"AABAA" => "BAA"
